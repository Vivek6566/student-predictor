Project Title
Predicting Student Final Grades Using Machine Learning

Objective
To build a predictive model that estimates a student’s final grade (G3) in a course based on various demographic, social, and academic factors.

Dataset Overview
Source: Likely the well-known Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (based on column names like school, sex, age, studytime, failures, etc.).
Target Variable: G3 — the final grade (0–20 scale).
Features: Include:
Demographics: gender (sex), age, urban/rural (address), family size (famsize)
Family background: parents’ education (Medu, Fedu), jobs (Mjob, Fjob), status (Pstatus)
Academic behavior: study time, past failures, school support, extra paid classes
Lifestyle: alcohol consumption (Dalc, Walc), going out, free time
School info: school type (GP/MS)
Key Steps in the Project
Data Loading & Inspection
Loaded dataset using pandas.
Used .head() and .info() to examine structure.
Checked for missing values with data.isnull().any() → no missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions:
Age groups
Urban vs. rural students (address)
Gender distribution (187 male, 208 female)
Created histograms, countplots, and scatter plots (e.g., age vs. Medu).
Analyzed correlations and patterns in student behavior.
Data Preprocessing
Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding (via pd.get_dummies() → stored in data_dum).
Prepared features (X) and target (y = G3).
Model Building
Split data: train_test_split(..., test_size=0.2, random_state=44)
Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.
Achieved a perfect R² score of 1.0 on the test set — which is highly suspicious and likely indicates data leakage (e.g., G1 and G2 — past grades — were included as features, which are strong proxies for G3).
Evaluation
Used model.score(X_test, y_test) → reported R² = 1.0, suggesting overfitting or leakage.
Critical Observations
Data Leakage Risk: The dataset includes G1 (first period grade) and G2 (second period grade), which are direct precursors to G3. Using them as features makes the prediction trivial and unrealistic in real-world scenarios (you can’t know G1/G2 before predicting G3 at the start of the term).
Over-Optimistic Performance: An R² of 1.0 is almost never realistic in educational prediction tasks unless future information is inadvertently used.
Potential Improvements
Exclude G1 and G2 to simulate real-time prediction at the start of the course.
Try other models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for better generalization.
Perform cross-validation and error analysis (e.g., MAE, RMSE).
Address class imbalance or grade distribution skew.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline on student performance data but likely suffers from data leakage, leading to unrealistically high accuracy. With proper feature selection (excluding past grades), it could serve as a realistic tool for early intervention in educational settings.
